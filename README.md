This a mini project so I can just revise using Typescript with Node, along with a configuration I can polish.

## Challenge

Could you please provide an implementation of the Fibonacci sequence in Typescript or Javascript? It can be written in Node.js or plain Javascript.

The implementation should use recursion. You should also have written a test for it that confirms the position of a Fibonacci number in its sequence.

For example, you might test that given these inputs, you get these outputs:

|INPUT | OUTPUT
--------------
|0     |  0
|3     |  1
|5     |  3
|7     |  8
|9     | 21

So, you would have a function that would take a number as an input, then return the Fibonnaci number that corresponded with that position.
