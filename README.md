# Background

This a mini project so I can just revise using Typescript with Node, along with a configuration I can polish. It's a coding exercise I used to set for applicants interviewing for various teams in various companies. It's an implementation of the Fibonacci sequence, taking a position number and returning the corresponding Fibonacci number. 

The exercise exposes:
* basic coding ability via recursion
* how to structure a RESTful web service
* how to test the service.

I've found it helpful as a revision topic. Most of what I have to revise is not how to program generally but the various config surrounding a program's business logic.

## Install

I wrote this using node v12.19.0. Any recent version of Node should work.

Then ...

```bash
npm install
make
```

## Example

```bash
> curl locahost:3000/11
{"position":11,"number":89}%
```
